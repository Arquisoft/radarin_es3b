=== User Experience concepts (UX)
==== User interface:
We didn´t decided the interface yet.

=== Domain concepts
We have the route that has points and multimedia files. We also have the location and the information about the author (date, name, url , path).

=== Design patterns
We didn´t decide the design yet. 

=== Architectural pattern
We will separate the application on layers. Business have the logic and the persistence where we will store the information of each user.

=== Development concepts
We have to develop this application using SOLID React Native.

=== Security concepts
Our app use SOLID architecture, where each user is identified with a WebId. To share routes we give permissions to that route, so the friend can see the route. If we copy the route to his pod it would has less security and privacy, because the application would have more permissions than necessary.
