=== User Experience concepts (UX)
==== User interface:
We will try to make the interface as easy to use as we can, to simplify the app to the users.

=== Domain concepts
The users, they need a pod id to save his information and use it.
We have the location and the information about the user thanks to his POD and MongoDB. We will work with friend request to share locations between users.
The Pod contains user information and his frinds, and MongoDB save the user location.

=== Design patterns
We didnÂ´t decide the design yet. 

=== Architectural pattern
We thought to use MVC pattern.

=== Development concepts
We will develop this application using SOLID. React Native will help us to use the phone app.

=== Security concepts
Our app use SOLID architecture, where each user is defined with a WebId. To share routes we give permissions to that route, so the friend can see the route. If we copy the route to his pod it would has less security and privacy, because the application would have more permissions than necessary.
