=== Acceptance tests

We've developed three user acceptance tests based in navigation through the page. 

The simplest one is just making sure the user sees the appropiate content when opening the application.

    Feature: Homepage title
        As a software developer
        I want our users to see the name of the app
        in the homepage

    Scenario: User opens the app
        When I go to the homepage
        Then I should see the app title

Another test checks the user can open the main navigation menu present in every view of the application.

    Feature: Nav display
        Any user before being logged in
        should see the nav menu when 
        the button is clicked

    Scenario: User opens nav
        When I click the button
        Then I expect to see the nav menu

Once opened the navigation menu, the next test makes sure the application renders the appropiate view when its link is clicked in the menu.

    Feature: User navigation

    Scenario: The user can navigate through different pages
        Given I am on the Home route
        When I click the nav and click the Administrador
        Then I expect to be on the Administrador route


=== Capacity tests

To simulate petitions to the webapp we've used Gatling.

Cases:

- A user logs in and logs out.
- Admin user opens the application.
- A user logs in and checks his friends list.
- A user opens the help section of the application.
- A user logs in, turns on the geolocation, receives the map showing his connected friends location. Then he turns off the geolocation and turns it on again. The user logs out.
- A user logs in and navigates through every single component of the application.

All these cases have been tested with a load of 1, 50 and 120 users.

=== Map and Notifications Management Flux Diagram

In the next diagram we show the rough internal structure of the code that manages the locations of the user's friend's and the notifications to the user.

Whenever a new update of the map arrives, that happens either every 5~ seconds or when the user first oppens the map, our application will loop through all the user's friends, check their location if they are connected to the map and send to the user a notification if a new friend connects to the map. After the loop, our application will show the updated map with the new markers to the user.
