Motivation::
The user interacts with our application, which uses a MongoDB database and communicates with the user's SOLID POD.
// ¿Debería añadir la API de geolocalización?

| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| User | User of the app. Will interact with the App.
| App | Web application that connects with the MongoDB database and with the PODs of the users of the application.

The WebApp is divided in 5 functionality blocks that work together.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Views | Controls the appearance of the application. Manages the different views of the application with routes defined in App.
| FriendList | Lists the names of the user's friends in their SOLID POD.
| ManageFriends | Allows the user to add or delete a friend using their WebID.
| Localization | Manages the localization of the user and displays it in a map together with the localizations of their friends. Uses the Restapi to store the users localization in the MongoDB database.
| Notifications | Manages the push notifications of the application. Sends a push notification to the user's browser when a new friend is in range.
| Admin | Has a login form to control the access. If the app user has succesfully logged in as admin, then they'll be able to delete or block a user of the application and see the unlabeled locations of the current users of the application.
